## Overview

Brief overview of the project and its purpose.

## Setup Decisions

### State Management with Redux

I chose to implement state management using Redux due to its centralized store and predictable state changes. Redux is well-suited for applications with complex state needs, providing a single source of truth that simplifies data flow and enhances maintainability.

### Mock Data Usage

To simulate backend interactions and test application functionality without a live backend, I opted to use mock data. This approach allows for rapid development and testing of frontend features, ensuring that components can handle various data scenarios.

### Other Decisions

- **Component Architecture**: Implemented using the atomic design methodology to promote reusability and maintainability of UI components.
  
- **Form Validation**: Utilized form validation to enhance user experience and ensure data integrity.
  
- **CSS-in-JS**: Leveraged [Library Name] for styling to maintain component-specific styles and improve CSS management.
